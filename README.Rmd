# roxytest

Inline tests with roxygen and testthat.

See demo package using this at [roxytest-demo](https://github.com/mikldk/roxytest-demo).

## Usage

There are a number of roclets included:

* `testthat_roclet`: Write [`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) tests in the [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) documentation
* `param_roclet`: Checks for consistency in documentation of parameters (too many/too few)

To use the package, add `roxytest` to `Imports` in the package's `DESCRIPTION` file, e.g.:

```
Imports:
  roxygen2, 
  testthat,
  roxytest
```

### `testthat` roclet

Add the following lines to your package's `DESCRIPTION` file:
```
Roxygen: list(roclets = c("namespace", "rd", "roxytest::testthat_roclet"))
```
(Or make appropriate changes to obtain similar results.) 

Then run the following:
```r
roxygen2::roxygenise()
```

### `param` roclet

Add the following lines to your package's `DESCRIPTION` file:
```
Roxygen: list(roclets = c("namespace", "rd", "roxytest::param_roclet"))
```
(Or make appropriate changes to obtain similar results.) 

Then run the following:
```r
roxygen2::roxygenise()
```

### Multiple roclets

You can of course also add both, e.g.:

```
Roxygen: list(roclets = c("namespace", "rd", 
                          "roxytest::testthat_roclet", "roxytest::param_roclet"))
```
(Or make appropriate changes to obtain similar results.) 

Then run the following:
```r
roxygen2::roxygenise()
```


## Examples

### `testthat` roclet

For example, if the file `R/functions.R` contains this code (from [roxytest-demo](https://github.com/mikldk/roxytest-demo)):

```r
#' A function to do x
#' 
#' @param x A number
#' 
#' @tests 
#' expect_equal(foo(2), sqrt(2))
#' expect_error(foo("a string"))
#' 
#' @return something
foo <- function(x) {
  return(sqrt(x))
}

#' A function to do y
#' 
#' @param x Character vector
#' @param y Character vector
#' 
#' @tests 
#' expect_equal(bar("A", "B"), paste("A", "B", sep = "/"))
#' 
#' @export
bar <- function(x, y) {
  paste0(x, "/", y)
}
```

Then `roxygen2::roxygenise()` will generate (with the `testthat_roclet` roclet) 
the file `tests/testthat/test-roxytest-functions.R` with this content:

```r
# Generated by roxytest: Do not edit by hand!

context("File R/functions.R"")

test_that("Function foo() @ L10", {
  expect_equal(foo(2), sqrt(2))
  expect_error(foo("a string"))
})


test_that("Function bar() @ L23", {
  expect_equal(bar("A", "B"), paste("A", "B", sep = "/"))
})
```

### `param` roclet

To demonstrate the `param_roclet` roclet assume that this block of documentation exists:

```r
#' Summing two numbers
#'
#' @param x A number
foobar <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

When the package is documented, the following output will be displayed:

```
Functions with @param inconsistency:
  * Function 'foobar' with title 'Summing two numbers': 
    - Missing @param's: y
```

Similarly if there are too many documented arguments.

## Wish-list


* Rstudio: CTRL+SHIFT+D option to run `devtools::document()`/`roxygen2::roxygenise()` instead of `devtools::document(roclets=c('rd', 'collate', 'namespace'))`
    + Project options -> Build tools -> If all check marks are removed, nothing happens with CTRL+SHIFT+D. If instead `devtools::document()` would be ran it would work.
    + See <https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/5201>
