# roxytest

Inline tests with roxygen and testthat.

See demo package using this at [roxytestdemo](https://github.com/mikldk/roxytestdemo).

## Usage

There are a number of roclets included:

* `testthat_roclet`: Write [`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) tests in the [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) documentation
* `param_roclet`: Checks for consistency in documentation of parameters (too many/too few)
* `return_roclet`: Checks if `@export`ed functions has `@return` documentation (possibly just `@return None`)
* `examples_roclet`: Checks if `@export`ed functions has `@examples` documentation

To use the package in your own package you do not need to add any additional
dependencies in your package's `DESCRIPTION` file apart from the usual
`Suggests: testthat` that is required for testing with `testthat`. (If you only
use `param_roclet` you do not need to add `testthat` to `Suggests`.)

```
Suggests:
  testthat
```

However, any developer working on your package needs to have `roxytest` installed
to be able to successfully run `roxygen2::roxygenise()` (or `devtools::document()`).
For this reason you may consider adding `roxytest` to `Suggests`, but this is
not required.

### `testthat` roclet

Add the following lines to your package's `DESCRIPTION` file (along with 
`Suggests: testthat`):
```
Roxygen: list(roclets = c("namespace", "rd", "roxytest::testthat_roclet"))
```
(Or make appropriate changes to obtain similar results.) 

Then run the following:
```r
roxygen2::roxygenise()
```

Similarly for the other roclets.

### Multiple roclets

You can of course also add multiple, e.g.:

```
Roxygen: list(roclets = c("namespace", "rd", 
                          "roxytest::testthat_roclet",
                          "roxytest::param_roclet",
                          "roxytest::return_roclet"))
```
(Or make appropriate changes to obtain similar results.) 

Then run the following:
```r
roxygen2::roxygenise()
```


## Examples

### `testthat` roclet

For example, if the file `R/functions.R` contains this code (from [roxytestdemo](https://github.com/mikldk/roxytestdemo)):

```r
#' A function to do x
#' 
#' @param x A number
#' 
#' @tests 
#' expect_equal(foo(2), sqrt(2))
#' expect_error(foo("a string"))
#' 
#' @return something
foo <- function(x) {
  return(sqrt(x))
}

#' A function to do y
#' 
#' @param x Character vector
#' @param y Character vector
#' 
#' @tests 
#' expect_equal(bar("A", "B"), paste("A", "B", sep = "/"))
#' 
#' @export
bar <- function(x, y) {
  paste0(x, "/", y)
}
```

Then `roxygen2::roxygenise()` will generate (with the `testthat_roclet` roclet) 
the file `tests/testthat/test-roxytest-functions.R` with this content:

```r
# Generated by roxytest: Do not edit by hand!

context("File R/functions.R")

test_that("Function foo() @ L10", {
  expect_equal(foo(2), sqrt(2))
  expect_error(foo("a string"))
})


test_that("Function bar() @ L23", {
  expect_equal(bar("A", "B"), paste("A", "B", sep = "/"))
})
```

### `param` roclet

To demonstrate the `param_roclet` roclet assume that this block of documentation exists:

```r
#' Summing two numbers
#'
#' @param x A number
foobar <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

When the package is documented, the following output will be displayed:

```
Functions with @param inconsistency:
  * Function 'foobar' with title 'Summing two numbers': 
    - Missing @param's: y
```

Similarly if there are too many documented arguments.


### `return` roclet

To demonstrate the `return_roclet` roclet assume that this block of documentation exists:

```r
#' Summing two numbers
#'
#' @param x A number
#' 
#' @export
foobar2 <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

When the package is documented, the following output will be displayed:

```
Functions with @export but no @return:
  * Function 'foobar2()' with title 'Summing two numbers'
```



### `examples` roclet

To demonstrate the `examples_roclet` roclet assume that this block of documentation exists:

```r
#' Summing two numbers
#'
#' @param x A number
#' 
#' @export
foobar2 <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

When the package is documented, the following output will be displayed:

```
Functions with @export but no @example(s):
  * Function 'foobar2()' with title 'Summing two numbers'
```


## Notes

* Rstudio: CTRL+SHIFT+D option does not run `devtools::document()` but only `devtools::document(roclets=c('rd', 'collate', 'namespace'))` (possibly with fewer, but not none)
    + Use `devtools`' `document()` addin: see e.g. [Rstudio documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/), and override the keyboard shortcut
